Github Pages was used to deploy this website. In order to do this you will need to take the following steps;

From the command line you will need to do the following;
>1. Change directory to where the files are located. For example your html file is located on your C drive on your desktop in a folder called test, you would use the **cd** commands to change directory to - C:User/desktop/test.
>2. Run Git using the **git init** command.
>3. Then add the file you want to push. For example **git add test.html**
>4. Then commit file. For example **git commit -m "first commit"**
>5. At this point you will be following commands that Github has provided for pushing "an existing repositry."
>![image](README_files/images/exist-repo.png)
>6. The command line will then prompt you to provide your **Github** **Username** and then **Password**, in order for it to push the files to the repository you created.

>7. This is now ready to be deployed on to Github Pages. Refreshing the page at this point should change the screen and show that your file has been pushed to the repository.
