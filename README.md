> ![image](assets/README_files/images/repo-push.png)

>- From the command line you will need to do the following;
>>- Change directory to where the files are located. For example your html file is located on your C drive on your desktop in a folder called test, you would use the **cd** commands to change directory to - C:User/desktop/test.
>>- Run Git using the **git init** command.
>>- Then add the file you want to push. For example **git add test.html**
