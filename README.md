Features
========

Existing Features
------------------
All 4 pages have a fixed navigation bar that allows you at any point to go to each page. They also have the same footer, consisting of a Contact Us section, links to the 
websites social media platforms, a Newsletter sign up feature, links to the City's Business Partners and a scroll to top feature that allows the user to pop straight back 
to the top of the page. 
I used the font Ubuntu throughout the website, which has a 
simple and clean look to it. Each Page also has a hero (or) banner image at the top with a title. I wanted a consistent start to each page, but then change each way the 
information is presented whilst keeping it inline with the style of website. The colour scheme of the website was is a mix of Black, Gray and White, which suits the Gothic 
feel of the City. I would then use accents of dark red and dark green to highlight certain links or features, as well as yellow, mainly for sections to do with Batman in 
order to signify these sections as special interest.

## [Landing Page](https://liamoconnor87.github.io/VisitGotham/index.html)

Top of the landing page has a hero image which is a distant view of the Gotham City. This is representing the idea of space between the user and Gotham. 
As you go down the page you see Gotham's slogan; 'Your origin story starts here'. This is designed to inspire the user further to choose Gotham as a 
destination and to sell you the idea of a great adventure, a story you could tell. As well as allude to Gotham's past hero's and deliberately make the user align 
themselves with them. 

The first section you come to is titled Things to do. It displays examples of things you can do in the city as a picture with a title underneath in a grid format. Each 
image and title links to that section on the Things To Do page. When you hover over the titles the colour changes from grey and white to black and white. Except for 
the Batman Memorial which goes from grey and white to black and yellow.

After this is a second banner image, designed to show case the city again visually with some interesting architecture, but also show a divide between the first and second section. 

The second section is titled City Info. This displays a series of links to certain sections on the City Info page. For consistency again displayed in a grid format in dark 
green and white, and as you hover over the title changes to black and white. 

At the bottom is the footer signifying the end of the page. 

## [Things To Do Page](https://liamoconnor87.github.io/VisitGotham/things_to_do.html)

At the top of the page it has a hero image which is a bird's eye view of two people kayaking down one of Gotham's rivers on St Patrick's day. The water is green, its an interesting 
image that entices the user to continue down the page to learn about things you can do in the city. The green of the image also stays consistent with the colour scheme of the website.

The title of the page Things To Do follows underneath as a way of reaffirming the users interest and what the page is about. 

The next section is broken up into nine categories with a brief description of things you can do in the city. These sections are the same as the landing page. Each category alternate 
in presentation. At desktop view go the first category is displayed with the image on the left with information to the right in grey and white. This presentation of the second category 
is alternated to image on the right with the information on the left now in black and white. This style alternates between these layouts and colours with each category as you go down 
the page. Once again to signify it's on individual importance, when you reach The Batman Memorial section. The colour scheme changes to black and yellow. 

At the bottom is the footer signifying the end of the page. 

## [City Info Page](https://liamoconnor87.github.io/VisitGotham/city_info.html)
At the top of the page it has a hero image of Gotham City's Town Hall. This is to represent a more official or serious consideration when the user is on this page. 
The title of the page, City Information follows underneath as a way of reaffirming the users interest and what the page is about. 

Following the title is a short official statement from the City on Covid-19. It is highlighted in red and white and covers the width of the page. This is 
designed to give it more relevance and importance for the user to see it.

Next is the City Information section. It's in an article format with a grey background and black font. This is to convey the information in a more serious tone and 'matter of fact' 
and is broken up into paragraphs that are easily readable for the user. 
In this section you also have links to other helpful material and phone numbers that the user might need when visiting Gotham. 

At the bottom is the footer signifying the end of the page. 

## [History Page](https://liamoconnor87.github.io/VisitGotham/history.html)
At the top of the page it has a hero image of Gotham City taken from Arkham Bridge, as this a page on Gotham's history this image of the skyline with cranes gave a good 
representation of Gotham continuous improvement from its dark past. 
The title of the page, Gotham's History follows underneath as a way of reaffirming the users interest and what the page is about.

Underneath this the page is broken into the following 5 categories;
- Folklore's Origins
- 17th Century
- 19th Century
- 20th Century
- Legend of Batman. 

Each paragraph is broken up with images alternating in there position as you go down the page as well as the paragraphs changing background colour from grey to black with white font. 
Of course when the user comes to the Legend of Batman section the background is yellow and the font is black. Again to highlight its significance. All the images correlate with there 
related information. For example; Legend of Batman section has images of Batman. 

At the bottom is the footer signifying the end of the page. 

## [Gotham City Map Preview](https://liamoconnor87.github.io/VisitGotham/gotham_map.html)
This page simply displays a preview Map of Gotham City. To signify this, the image is centred on the page titled with Gotham City Map with a grey background behind it. 
It has two features. A Return link to go back to the previous page and a download link so the user can keep copy should they visit.
