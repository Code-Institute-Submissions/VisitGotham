**Websites responsiveness**
---------------------------

Website responsive layout was primarily tested on Google Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi using the Developer Tools. The website also worked well with Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox.
The website also works well with smart devices.

## Desktop View's ##
**images of index, things, city, hist and map page**

## Ipad Pro View's ##
**images of index, things, city, hist and map page**

## Ipad View's ##
**images of index, things, city, hist and map page**

## Iphone View's ##
**images of index, things, city, hist and map page**

**Bugs and Problems**

I initally wrote the code with each title and image within its own individual tag and anchor. **(show example)** Three img tags in a line and then three h tags. This became problematic for a responsive layout. As the screen size changed all the tags moved independently and away from there correlating title. 
I fixed this by wrapping an image and its correlating title with a parent element. 

I struggled to get this layout to work responsively. I fixed this by using the flew-wrap protperty in CSS.
