        <h3>Special Update: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information and Resources</h3>
        <p>We continue to monitor the evolving situation regarding the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). For more, 
        including health and safety tips, visit our coronavirus information and resources page.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Welcome to NYC</h3>
        <p>Planning a trip to the five boroughs can be part of the fun, but there’s also a lot of ground to cover. 
        Click the categories on the left-side/top navigation to find information about subjects that require in-depth 
        looks, such as transportation and accessibility. Below you’ll find quick overviews on other essential things, 
        like the City’s layout, the local time zone and various visitor passes.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>New York City is composed of five boroughs.  While Manhattan and Staten Island are islands, Brooklyn and 
        Queens are geographically part of Long Island, and the Bronx is attached to the US mainland. The islands are 
        linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. Check here for helpful NYC maps and guides. 
        <br>
        Manhattan is roughly 13.4 miles long and about 2.3 miles wide at its widest. Except at its northern and southern 
        tips, the borough’s avenues run roughly north and south, and streets run east and west. One-way thoroughfares are 
        common, with traffic moving east on even-numbered streets and west on odd-numbered streets. Fifth Avenue divides 
        the island into east and west sides (for example, locations on 57th Street west of Fifth Avenue are designated 
        “W. 57th St.,” and east of Fifth Avenue, they’re “E. 57th St.”). As you move farther east or west from Fifth 
        Avenue, street addresses increase, usually in increments of 100 from one block to the next. For north-south 
        avenues, 20 blocks equals a mile, and the street numbers increase as you go uptown. Blocks can be a useful measure 
        of distance, but keep in mind your direction: walking uptown from 1st Street to 6th Street is about a quarter of a 
        mile, but walking the same number of blocks crosstown, from First Avenue to Sixth Avenue, is approximately a mile.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Time Zone</h3>
        <p>New York City is on Eastern Standard Time (Greenwich mean time minus four hours during daylight saving time, 
        from about mid-March into early November, and minus five hours the rest of the year).</p>

        <h3>Local Laws</h3>
        <p>If you’re headed out for a night on the town, you should know that the drinking age in NYC—and throughout 
        the United States—is 21, and smoking is banned in public places throughout the City, including bars, restaurants, 
        subways and taxis, and public parks and beaches. Cigar smoking is permitted at cigar bars. In NYC, only those 
        who are 21 or older can purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products and electronic cigarettes. Under current 
        law, marijuana remains illegal in the City (and state), though a government-backed push toward its legalization 
        may change things as early as 2019.</p>

        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>New York is America’s safest large city, but visitors should still use common sense to protect themselves and their property. 
        Be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to always use licensed, reputable businesses for any services you need. For 
        example, don’t hail livery cabs (as opposed to taxis) at the airport, and don’t rent bikes from companies that seem suspicious. 
        If you’re not sure where to find legitimate businesses, the listings at nycgo.com are a good place to start, as are those 
        published by the Better Business Bureau. Your hotel concierge should be able to answer questions on this topic and will be 
        helpful if you need more information about neighborhoods in the five boroughs. Another useful resource is 311, the City’s 
        official government services and information hotline. For more information about safety, read our tips for visitors.</p>
