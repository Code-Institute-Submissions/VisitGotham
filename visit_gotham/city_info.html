            <h2>Welcome to Gotham City</h2>
            <p>Planning a trip to the nine-island boroughs can be part of the fun, but there’s also a lot of ground to cover. 
            Below you’ll find quick overviews on other essential things, like the City’s layout, the local time zone and 
            various visitor passes.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Gotham City is composed of nine islands. Although the majority of the city consists of the three main 
            islands - Uptown, Midtown and Downtown Island. All nine islands are linked by bridges, tunnels and ferries. 
            Click here to download a Map of Gotham City. 
            <br>
            Midtown Island is roughly 12.4 miles wide and about 4.3 miles at its longest. Except at its eastern and western 
            tips, the borough’s avenues run roughly north and south, and streets run east and west. One-way thorough fares are 
            common, with traffic moving east on even-numbered streets and west on odd-numbered streets. 
            <br>
            Robinson Park is regarded as the center of the city dividing into east and west sides. As you move farther east or west 
            from Robinson Park, street addresses increase, usually in increments of 100 from one block to the next. For north-south 
            avenues, 20 blocks equals a mile, and the street numbers increase as you go towards Uptown Island. Blocks can be a useful 
            measure of distance, but keep in mind your direction: walking towards Uptown Island from 1st Street to 6th Street is 
            about a quarter of a mile, but walking the same number of blocks crosstown, from First Avenue to Sixth Avenue, is 
            approximately a mile.</p>

            the United States—is 21, and smoking is banned in public places throughout the City, including bars, restaurants, 
            subways and taxis, and public parks and beaches. Cigar smoking is permitted at cigar bars. In Gotham, only those 
            who are 21 or older can purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products and electronic cigarettes. Under current 
            law, marijuana remains illegal in the City (and state), though a government-backed push toward its legalization 
            may change things as early as 2021.</p>

            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>Gotham is America’s rising star in safety for large cities, but visitors should still use common sense to protect 
            themselves and their property. 
            Be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to always use licensed, reputable businesses for any services you need. For 
            example, don’t hail livery cabs (as opposed to taxis) at the airport, and don’t rent bikes from companies that seem suspicious. 
            If you’re not sure where to find legitimate businesses, the listings at gothamgo.com are a good place to start, as are those 
            published by the Better Business Bureau. Your hotel concierge should be able to answer questions on this topic and will be 
            helpful if you need more information about neighborhoods in the five boroughs. Another useful resource is 411, the City’s 
            official government services and information hotline. For more information about safety, read our tips for visitors.</p>
