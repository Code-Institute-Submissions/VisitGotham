        <h2>Gotham Zoo</h2>
        <p>
        Gotham Zoo is one of the oldest in the country, 
        first opening on its current site in 1939. In the 1980s, The Gotham Wildlife 
        Conservation Society assumed management of the park under a contract with 
        the City of Gotham and completed a dramatic five year transformation. Since 
        reopening in 1988, our mission has been to engage future generations of 
        conservationists and create wildlife champions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The zoo is open every day of the year and features three major biomes: the 
        Tropic Zone, Temperate Territory, and our famous Polar Circle. From tropical birds, 
        to snow leopards, grizzly bears, and one of the nation’s largest colonies of 
        Antarctic penguins, there are animals to enjoy in every season. We also feature 
        the Robin Children’s Zoo, a playful adventure for our youngest guests who’ll 
        encounter goats, sheep, some of the world’s most unique ducks, and the only cow 
        who calls Gotham home. Our goal is to inspire our visitors and connect them 
        to the plight of animals in the wild and the conservation work we’re doing to 
        protect them.
